## Project:  Analyse Promotions and Provide Tangible Insights to Sales Director

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.  

Sales director Bruce Haryali wanted this immediately but the analytics manager Tony is engaged on another critical project. Tony decided to give this work to Peter Pandey who is the curious data analyst of AtliQ Mart. Since these insights will be directly reported to the sales director, Tony also provided some notes to Peter to support his work.

## üîñKey Features:
1. A sales performance report categorizing promotions into successful and unsuccessful.
2. Insights on customer behavior and preferences during the festive season.
3. Recommendations for future promotional strategies based on data trends.
4. Possibly a dashboard or visual report for quick decision-making.
